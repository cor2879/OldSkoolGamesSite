        <p>David Cole is a seasoned Software Engineer with over 18 years of experience in the tech industry. He has worked at some of the most prestigious companies, including Microsoft, where he honed his skills in software development, project management, and mentoring. His journey in software development has seen him design and implement complex systems, lead engineering teams, and bring innovative ideas to life across a range of platforms.</p>
        
        <p>In 2019, David founded Old Skool Games, driven by his passion for retro gaming and his desire to create games that capture the timeless magic of the 80s and 90s. With a deep appreciation for classic game design and a love for pixel art, David develops games that resonate with both nostalgic gamers and a new generation of players. His work is a tribute to the simplicity and creativity of early video games, combined with modern technology and techniques.</p>
        
        <p>But David's journey is more than just one of professional achievement. In 2021, he survived a Near-Death Experience that profoundly changed his life. During this experience, he glimpsed the other side and encountered the Divine Presence known to many as the Mighty I AM. This spiritual awakening led David to a deeper understanding of himself and the world around him, revealing to him much about his true nature as it relates to our Creator.</p>
        
        <p>Beyond software and game development, David dedicates his time to exploring and teaching spiritual, esoteric, and ancient wisdom. Through his short videos, David shares insights on spirituality, angelic realms, and the deeper mysteries of life. His teachings aim to uplift and inspire others, helping them to connect with their own spiritual paths.</p>
        
        <p>David’s work, both in technology and spirituality, reflects a unique blend of technical expertise and profound spiritual insight. Whether you’re engaging with one of his retro-inspired games, utilizing an app, seeking consultation for a software project, or watching one of his enlightening videos, you’re connecting with a creator who is deeply passionate about both the seen and unseen worlds.</p>
